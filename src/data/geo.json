It is particularly useful for visualizing specific themes and datasets, such as cycling infrastructure, public transportation, or cultural heritage.\n\n**Features**:\n\n*   **Theme-based Mapping**: Users can choose from various themes, each highlighting different types of data. For example, there are themes for bicycle parking, public art, trees, and more.\n*   **Interactive Interface**: MapComplete provides an intuitive interface that allows users to click on map elements and edit their properties directly.\n*   **Visualization**: It emphasizes the visualization of OSM data, making it easier to see what data is already present and what might be missing or incorrect.\n*   **Customization**: Users and communities can create custom themes tailored to specific needs or interests.\n\nStreetComplete\n--------------\n\n**Purpose**: StreetComplete is a mobile application focused on improving OpenStreetMap by allowing users to answer simple, survey-style questions about their surroundings. It targets casual users who can contribute data without needing in-depth knowledge of OSM.\n\n**Features**:\n\n*   **Quest-based System**: Users are presented with quests, which are questions about nearby map features. These might include details like building addresses, road surface types, or amenity opening hours.\n*   **Mobile-friendly**: Designed specifically for mobile use, StreetComplete leverages the GPS capabilities of smartphones to present relevant quests based on the user’s location.\n*   **User-friendly**: The app simplifies the process of contributing to OSM, making it accessible to anyone, including those without mapping experience.\n*   **Automatic Upload**: Once users complete quests, the app automatically uploads the data to OSM, ensuring contributions are quickly integrated into the map.\n\nComparison\n----------\n\nAspect\n\nMapComplete\n\nStreetComplete\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nBoth casual and experienced mappers interested in specific themes and visualization.\n\nCasual mappers looking for a straightforward way to contribute via their mobile devices.\n\n**Usability**\n\nRicher, more detailed interface suitable for desktop use and thematic exploration.\n\nGamified, easy-to-use experience for on-the-go contributions.\n\n**Functionality**\n\nAllows for detailed edits and visualizations based on selected themes, providing a comprehensive tool for exploring and enhancing specific types of OSM data.\n\nFocuses on answering specific questions about the environment, making it simpler but less comprehensive in terms of data management.\n\n**Contribution Style**\n\nUsers might engage in more complex edits and data management, often in a targeted way based on themes.\n\nUsers contribute by answering predefined questions, making contributions easier but more guided and limited to what the app presents."
